The Assignment – Leo’s Tax Calculator 

######################################################     PROBLEM   ###########################################################

Dr. Sab’s company, Leo Stores, has a billing system that has been generating some unusually big bills of late. Mrs. Daruwala was billed ₹30,000 tax for buying 5 items at the store. 
Dr. Sab has had enough! He wants a quality tax calculator and wants YOU to program it. 
 
Tax Calculator Logic 
Basic tax is 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products, which are exempted. Import duty is an additional 5% tax on all imported goods with no exemptions. 
When you purchase items you receive a receipt, which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of taxes paid. The tax is rounded up to the nearest 5 paisa. 
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets:
